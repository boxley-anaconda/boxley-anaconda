- 👋 Hi, I’m Brian Oxley (or "boxley" on teams with a lot of Brians). I work for [Zencohen](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zencohen-consulting/).
- 👀 Beyond my remit for software delivery, I’m interested in "Making people awesome"&mdash;[a key Agile value](https://modernagile.org/).
- 🌱 I’m currently catching up on Anaconda. I've watched it grow for 10+ years, and now get to contribute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding options for AI MML model discovery.
- 📫 How to reach me is best with <brian.oxley@zencohen.com> or in Slack.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to play bridge and D&D, and am a classical musician.
